    <p>Patrick Bahitya has two years of experience in the private sector. In addition to the experience he gained in Solar PV following a National Diploma in Electrical Engineering of Uganda Technical College-Kyema that he obtained and holds, he is just counting days to complete a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science on 20th May, 2019 from Lira University. He is technology motivated. Patrick has worked to see and believe that technology can solve most of the problems faced by the society today. He worked with BBOXX Capital Uganda Limited, to see how ICT is integrated in the renewable energy sector to come up with SMART Solar solutions. BBOXX is an international company based in London in the solar revolution across the developing world, currently operating in 14 different countries and has already electrified 200,000 people with Solar Systems. They are aiming to make that number 20 Million by the year 2020. Such technological insights motivated Patrick to go back to school and get the required knowledge and skills in the field of ICT, with a mission to use technology to come up with solutions that have health, social-economic and environmental benefits in the society. As one of the National finalists in the Huawei 2018-2019 Global ICT Competition, and also National finalist in the Huawei Seeds for future 2018 flagship program, programs initiated by Huawei to tap top best university students with the best and economically feasible technological solutions to solve Uganda’s current problems in the Health, Transport, Agriculture, Commerce and Education sector, Patrick is following his original vision to use technology to change the world. Through the experiences, Patrick has gained knowledge and developed skills in leadership, communication, interpersonal relations. His passion is to empower the youth and the marginalized communities in the hardest areas to reach through technological solutions.
